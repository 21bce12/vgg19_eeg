This is a project-based development and implementation of an EEG-based cognitive classification system using transfer learning.
Designed and implemented a transfer learning framework for EEG-based cognitive classification, achieving 98.6 percent accuracy in distinguishing cognitive abilities in sports and non-sports groups.
Developed a robust EEG data preprocessing pipeline using band-pass filtering and ICA, which significantly enhanced signal clarity by reducing noise and artifacts.
Compared CNN models (VGG-16, VGG-19, InceptionV3, and custom CNN)
